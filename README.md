I've recently graduated from Codaisseur and I'm excited to continue to challenge myself going forward! I've been trained in creating fullstack applications, and I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge in React Native.

### Current projects:

#### üê≠ Mausritter charactersheet :mouse:

For my graduate project I have been building an app to create and save a charactersheet for the tabletop game Mausritter. After finishing this project, I want to convert the app to React Native so it's also usable on apple and android devices.
